An international research team with the involvement of the Universities of Zurich and Halle-Wittenberg has evaluated the data from subtropical forests planted in southeastern China with more than 200,000 woody plants. The results highlight the importance of conserving biodiversity in species-rich ecosystems, and warns us that previous studies based on random species loss could bias our predictions of how more realistic extinction scenarios are likely to affect ecosystem functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest biodiversity experiment, BEF-China, began in 2009 with the collaboration among institutions in China, Germany and Switzerland. The international team simulated both random and directed species extinction scenarios along richness gradients from 16 to 1 species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eight years, directed species loss in species-rich forest ecosystems, in which evolutionary distinct species had higher extinction risks, showed much stronger reductions in forest productivity than did treatments that were subject to random species loss. “These findings have significant implications for biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation, because more productive forests also removed more carbon dioxide from the air”, says Prof. Bernhard Schmid of the University of Zurich, senior author of the current publication in Nature Ecology &amp;amp; Evolution. “Our results suggest that species loss can severely hamper ecosystem functioning already at high species richness, when many species still remain in the ecosystem. It challenges the decade-long assumption derived from studies based on random species loss. This assumption was that species loss from high-diversity communities would have only little impact on ecosystem functioning, because the remaining species could take over the functions of extinct species due to species redundancy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why could directed species loss lead to such strong productivity reduction? “We think two processes associated with directed species loss might lead to the results,” explains Dr. Yuxin Chen, now associate professor at Xiamen University in China and the first author of the current publication. “When species loss is directed, we may lose the most functionally distinct species first, if that functionally distinctiveness is also the cause of extinction. Species do not live independently, but participate in complex networks of species interactions. Losing species can change these interaction networks. The loss of species interactions contributed significantly to the observed results.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ongoing impacts of a severe coronavirus epidemic this winter has prompted China to speed up biosecurity legislation and elevate it to a national security issue. The biosecurity law would cover various areas including conserving biodiversity. “Our research is grounded in one of the diversity hotspots in China. The findings are timely for supporting the legislation of biosecurity. Diversity loss from species-rich forests could also increase the risk of pest and disease outbreaks. Some other research teams are studying this issue at BEF-China” says Prof. Keping Ma of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, co-founder of the BEF-China experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

An international research team with the involvement of the University of Zurich has evaluated data from forests grown specifically for this purpose in China with a total of over 150,000 trees. The results speak in favor of using many different tree species during reforestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, BEF-China began as a unique forest biodiversity experiment in collaboration between institutions in China, Germany and Switzerland. The large-scale project investigated the importance of tree species richness for the good functioning of forest ecosystems. Stands of trees comprising different numbers of species were planted – from monocultures to highly species-rich plots with 16 different tree species on an area of 670 square meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eight years, such species-rich forest plots stored an average of 32 tons of carbon per hectare in aboveground biomass. By contrast, monocultures averaged only 12 tons of carbon per hectare – less than half as much. During photosynthesis, the plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert the carbon to biomass. When a forest stores more carbon, this helps reduce greenhouse gases and at the same time also indicates high forest productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biodiverse forests are more productive
The fact that biodiversity increases productivity had previously been demonstrated through exper-iments in grassland ecosystems in Europe and the USA. By contrast, since it was assumed that all tree species occupy similar ecological niches, a minimal effect of biodiversity was conjectured for forests. Evidently, however, this assumption was wrong. “In the forest biodiversity experiment, biomass increased just as quickly with species richness as it did in the meadow ecosystems. As a result, even after just four years, there were clear differences between the monocultures and the species-rich forests,” explains Prof. Helge Bruelheide of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, co-director of the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), which together with the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences oversaw the field experiments. These differences grew continuously over further four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These findings have great ecological and economic significance,” says Prof. Bernhard Schmid of the University of Zurich, senior author in the more than 60-strong writing team of the current publication in Science. A previous study already found a positive correlation between biodiversity and carbon storage. However, it was based on simple comparison of natural plots varying in species richness. “Therefore, it was impossible to conclude that higher biodiversity was the cause of the higher productivity. But now we have reached the same conclusion with an experiment under controlled conditions: a forest with a large number of tree species is more productive than a monoculture,” adds Prof. Dr. Keping Ma of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and co-manager of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher productivity, better climate protection
Worldwide, there are plans for major reforestation programs with the aim of protecting the climate through the planting of new forests. In China alone, between 2010 and 2015, 1.5 million hectares of new forest were planted each year, although mainly with fast-growing monocultures. “Our new study shows that forests are not all the same when it comes to climate protection: monocultures achieve not even half of the desired ecosystem service. The full level of carbon sequestration and thus mitigation of global warming can only be achieved with a mix of species. In addition, species-rich forests also contribute towards protecting the world’s threatened biodiversity,” ex-plains Bernhard Schmid. “Unfortunately, there’s still a widespread misconception that productivity and biodiversity are mutually exclusive, but the opposite is true.” Species-rich forests are also less vulnerable when it comes to diseases or extreme weather events, which are becoming increasingly frequent as a result of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the effects observed in the experiment are extrapolated to the world’s existing forests, it can be concluded that a 10% decline in tree species would lead to production losses of 20 billion US dollars, worldwide, per year. This result shows that, according to the researchers, reforestation with a mix of different species also pays off economically.&lt;/p&gt;

If a mixture of tree species instead of monocultures were planted, much more carbon could be stored. An international team including UZH researchers has shown that species-rich forest ecosystems take up more CO2 from the atmosphere and store more carbon in biomass and soil, making them more effective against climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forest ecosystems are elementary for a climatic balance. Countries such as China have recognized this fact; for years, they have been conducting extensive afforestation programs to compensate their rising CO2 emissions. As part of the global carbon cycle, forests take up about 45 percent of the carbon from the environment and bind it in the soil and as biomass over long periods of time. At the same time, trees can take up or release carbon in the short term, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, however, there has been little research into whether the number of tree species in a forest has an influence on the carbon cycle in the ecosystem. A team of researchers from Switzerland, Germany and China has now collated comprehensive data on 27 forest allotments in the province of Zhejiang in subtropical southeastern China for a period of six years. The researchers, including some from UZH – investigated the amount of long-term, stored carbon (C stock) and the short-term carbon exchange (C flux). The forest allotments were chosen to represent a richness gradient ranging from three to 20 tree species and an age range from 22 to 116-year-old tree stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each additional species contributes 6.4 percent higher carbon stores
Previous afforestation efforts in China have already contributed considerably to reducing the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. “However, China has limited its program to monocultures,” explains Bernhard Schmid, professor of environmental sciences at the University of Zurich. “We wanted to find out whether a mixture of tree species compensates more carbon than just a single tree species.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that species-rich forests have a faster carbon cycle than those with just a few species. With increased species richness, more carbon is stored both above and below ground in trunks, roots, deadwood, mold and soil. Estimations of the team of researchers have shown that 6.4 percent more carbon can be compensated with each additional tree species in an allotment. In addition, older trees accumulate more carbon than younger ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$300 million a year blown out into the atmosphere
“Projected to all of China, additional carbon at a value of $300 million a year could have been absorbed from the atmosphere from 1977 to 2008 if species-rich allotments with 10 tree species had been planted instead of monocultures,” says Bernhard Schmid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce the atmospheric CO2 impact, the researchers therefore suggest planting species-rich tree mixtures in global reforestation programs as much as possible instead of using monocultures. The goals of fighting against global warming and preventing further loss of biodiversity in forests could thus be reached at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-brief-introduction&quot;&gt;Project brief introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the BEF-China experiment, strong associations between herbivores, herbivory, and tree diversity at the community level，potentially be broken down into associational effects at the tree individual level. The species composition and diversity of the wider local neighborhood are likely to influence such local effects. The relative importance of the potential mechanisms underlying such associational effects, and their scale-dependence, may be contingent on species traits, such as mobility and host specialization of herbivores. Functional traits of species describe how they respond to the environment, trait-based data also facilitate comparison of biodiversity effects across ecosystems in contrast to taxon-specific approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-questions&quot;&gt;Main Questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i) How tree-tree interaction in the context of tree diversity affect herbivores (e.g. species richness/ abundance)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ii)To preliminarily discuss the adaption of herbivores to host plants from the functional traits view (e.g. mouthparts).&lt;/p&gt;
