Project Name: The effects of tree diversity on tree-caterpillar-parasitoid interactionc and the responses of herbivores to associational effects of tree pairs within tree diversity gradient.

Applicant name: Yi Li
Supervisor: Chaodong Zhu
Other people involved：Pengfei Guo, Jingting Chen, Zhong Zhang, Guangfu Yu, Weifeng Zhang


## Project brief introduction:

In the BEF-China experiment, strong associations between herbivores, herbivory, and tree diversity at the community level，potentially be broken down into associational effects at the tree individual level. The species composition and diversity of the wider local neighborhood are likely to influence such local effects. The relative importance of the potential mechanisms underlying such associational effects, and their scale-dependence, may be contingent on species traits, such as mobility and host specialization of herbivores. Functional traits of species describe how they respond to the environment, trait-based data also facilitate comparison of biodiversity effects across ecosystems in contrast to taxon-specific approaches.


## Main Questions

i) How tree-tree interaction in the context of tree diversity affect herbivores (e.g. species richness/ abundance)?

ii)To preliminarily discuss the adaption of herbivores to host plants from the functional traits view (e.g. mouthparts).

iii)How tree diversity affect the interactions between tree, caterpillars and parasitoids?"
