The joint Chinese-German-Swiss research project “BEF-China” (FOR 891) integrates more than 15 German, Swiss, and Chinese universities and institutes into 13 collaborative subprojects. The project was funded from 2008-2016.
The research concentrates on measuring ecosystem functions in the experimental plots, namely primary productivity, carbon and nitrogen storage, nutrient cycling, prevention of soil erosion, multi-trophic interactions (herb layer, soil macrofauna, herbivores, decomposers, mycorrhiza, soil microorganisms).
