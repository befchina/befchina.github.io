Human-induced biodiversity loss is threatening ecosystem function. Previous studies has provided evidences that the biodiversity and ecosystem functions of consumers were affected by changes in plant diversity. However, we still lack a general understanding of the interactive effects of biodiversity change across trophic levels.

The members from Chao-Dong Zhu’s Lab sampled arboreal spiders and lepidopteran larvae across seasons in two years in the subtropical tree diversity experiment, and then disentangled the links between tree diversity and arthropod predator diversity by deconstructing the pathways among multiple components of diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) with structural equation models. They found that herbivores were major mediators of tree species richness effects on abundance, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity of predators (Fig. 3), while phylogenetic, functional and structural diversity of trees were also important mediators of this process (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). However, the strength and direction differed between functional, structural and phylogenetic diversity effects (Fig. 4), indicating different underlying mechanisms for predator community assembly. Abundance and multiple diversity components of predators were consistently affected by tree functional diversity, indicating that the variation of structure and environment caused by plant functional composition might play key roles in predator community assembly.
