Forests worldwide are increasingly challenged by environmental change, which drives biodiversity loss and heightens the risk of biotic disturbances such as insect outbreaks. While research has often emphasized plants when assessing biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships, higher trophic levels like herbivores are equally important, both for ecosystem functioning and as drivers of disturbances. Understanding the mechanisms that govern herbivore community stability is therefore crucial for both ecological theory and forest management.

A recent study led by led by Ming-Qiang Wang, Arong Luo, Chao-Dong Zhu and Andreas Schuldt from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and University of Göttingen, together with the Institute of Botany (CAS), addressed this question using six years of data from the BEF-China forest biodiversity experiment. The team monitored 17,850 Lepidoptera larvae representing 870 MOTUs to uncover how tree diversity, tree growth, functional traits, and microclimate jointly influence the temporal and spatial stability of herbivore communities in subtropical forests.

The researchers found that herbivore communities fluctuated strongly over time, broadly tracking seasonal climate, especially winter temperature and precipitation. Yet tree species richness consistently buffered these fluctuations, enhancing both temporal and spatial stability of larval communities. By promoting stability, tree diversity exerted stronger positive effects on community abundance, richness, and phylogenetic diversity than the counteracting influences of functional diversity, tree growth, or climate variability. The stabilizing role of diversity was further reflected in reduced spatiotemporal turnover and more consistent community composition, while increased phylogenetic complementarity among species lineages contributed to long-term resilience.

These findings highlight that tree diversity acts as a key ecological regulator, mitigating the adverse impacts of climate variability on herbivore communities. In contrast, tree growth dynamics and microclimate exerted largely independent influences, suggesting that multiple bottom-up pathways jointly shape herbivore stability. As global biodiversity continues to decline, such stabilizing mechanisms may weaken, raising the risk of insect outbreaks.

The study, published in Ecological Monographs and titled “Tree diversity, tree growth, and microclimate independently structure Lepidoptera herbivore community stability”, provides new evidence for how biodiversity fosters resilience in forest ecosystems. It also lays a theoretical foundation for exploring plant–herbivore asynchrony and top-down regulation by natural enemies, offering valuable insights for forest management under global change.
