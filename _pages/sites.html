        <p><h4>Comparative Study Plots (CSPs)</h4></p>
        <p class="textalign">The 27 CSPs were established between May and July 2008 in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve, Zhejiang Province, southeast China (29°14'N, 118°07'E) with a size of 30 × 30 m for each one. The region is characterized by a typical seasonal subtropical monsoon climate with hot and humid summers contrasted by cool and relatively dry winters.
          The potential natural vegetation is a diverse mixed evergreen broad-leaved forest with <span style="font-style:italic">Castanopsis eyrei, Cyclobalanopsis glauca</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Schima superba</span> as the most abundant species. The 27 CSPs plots were randomly selected, stratified by successional age.
          The number of plots per successional stage were 5 (<20 yr), 4 (<40 yr), 5(<60 yr), 6 (<80 yr), and 7 (≥80 yr). According to the first plant investigation, there are 148 species of woody plants with plant height greater than 1 m, belonging to 46 families.

        <p><h4>The BEF-China Main Experiment</h4></p>
        <p class="textalign">The BEF-China main experiment sites are located near Xingangshan, Dexing, Jiangxi Province in southeast China (117°54'E, 29°07'N, see Figure1A and 1C), which is about 40 km southeast of the CSPs. The experiment consists of two experimental sites (Site A and Site B) of ca 20 ha each. 566 experimental plots were established on two different sites that were planted in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Every plot has a size of 25.82m × 25.82m in horizontal projection which corresponds to the traditional Chinese area unit of 1 mu, of which 64 super plots (4-mu plots) were set up for shrub additional planting. The plant species pool was consists of <a href = "{{site.beseurl}}/assets/projects/species.pdf">42 tree species and 18 shrub species</a>, within which seven levels of tree species richness were established (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 tree species) and 5 levels of shrub species richness (0, 2, 4, 8 shrub species in 4-mu plots and shrub monoculture plots). On each plot 400 tree individuals were planted in 20 × 20 regularly arranged columns and rows, with a distance of 1.29 m among trees. Therefore, more than 300,000 tree and shrub saplings were planted in total since 2008. The planting pattern was carried out by two kinds of extinction series: random extinction series and non-random extinction series. BEF-China experiment is currently the largest tree diversity experiment in the world.
