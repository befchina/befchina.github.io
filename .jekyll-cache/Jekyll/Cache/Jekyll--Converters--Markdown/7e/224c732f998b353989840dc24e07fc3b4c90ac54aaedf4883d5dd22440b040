I"e<p>At high species richness, directed loss, but not random loss, of tree species strongly decreases forest productivity. An international research team with the involvement of the Universities of Zurich and Halle-Wittenberg has evaluated the data from subtropical forests planted in southeastern China with more than 200,000 woody plants. The results highlight the importance of conserving biodiversity in species-rich ecosystems, and warns us that previous studies based on random species loss could bias our predictions of how more realistic extinction scenarios are likely to affect ecosystem functioning.</p>
