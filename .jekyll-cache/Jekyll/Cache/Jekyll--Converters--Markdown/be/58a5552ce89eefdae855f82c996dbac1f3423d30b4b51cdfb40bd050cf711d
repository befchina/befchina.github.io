I"î<p>The International Research Training Group ‚ÄúTreeD√¨ ‚Äì Tree Diversity Interactions: The role of tree-tree interactions in local neighborhoods in Chinese subtropical forests‚Äù (GRK 2324), funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), invites applications for 9 doctoral researchers in Germany. TreeD√¨ <a href="www.treedi.de">www.treedi.de</a> is operated by Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and its partner universities Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) and University of Leipzig (UL) in cooperation with the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig, the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS).</p>

<p>The aim of TreeD√¨ ‚Äì ÊûóÂú∞ (l√≠n d√¨, forest land) is to understand how tree-tree interactions in local neighbourhoods of varying diversity translate into observed tree species richness effects on key ecosystem functions at the community scale. In addition, TreeD√¨ seeks to understand the role of the forest understorey (shrub species composition and diversity) for ecosystem functioning. All research projects are carried out on the BEF-China platform in subtropical China ‚Äì the largest forest BEF experiment worldwide <a href="https://bef-china.com">https://bef-china.com</a>.</p>

<p>By bringing together experts and doctoral researchers from leading research institutions located in Germany and China, TreeD√¨ creates a stimulating network of excellence. TreeD√¨ features an international qualification programme involving an intensive Chinese-German cultural exchange during a 6-month research visit in the partners‚Äô countries, a joint PhD advisory committee (PAC) composed of Chinese and German experts, and unique offers to meet, study and discuss with figureheads in biodiversity research.</p>
