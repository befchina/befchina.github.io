  <li>Biodiversity is considered to mitigate detrimental impacts of climate change on the functioning of forest ecosystems, such as drought‚Äêinduced decline in forest productivity. However, previous studies produced controversial results and experimental evidence is rare. Specifically, the biological mechanisms underlying mitigation effects remain unclear, as existing work focuses on biodiversity effects related to the community scale.</li>
