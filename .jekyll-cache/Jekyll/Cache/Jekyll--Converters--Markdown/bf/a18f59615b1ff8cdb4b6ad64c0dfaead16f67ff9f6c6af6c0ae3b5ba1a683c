I"Ñ<p>Plant-herbivore interactions is a key ecological process in ecosystem functioning and is usually altered by global environmental change, especially plant diversity. Previous study mostly has emphasized the effects of plant diversity on plant-herbivore networks in grasslands. For forests, however, we still lack a general understanding of how changes in tree diversity, functional traits and phylogenetic composition affect the plant-herbivore interactions.</p>
