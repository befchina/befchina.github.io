          <h2>BEF-China</h2>
          <p>The BEF-China platform has been jointly set up by the Chinese, German and Swiss researchers since 2008. Biodiversityâ€“Ecosystem Functioning (BEF) experiments aim at explaining effects of species loss on ecosystem variables such as productivity, nutrient cycling or stability and at deciphering the underlying processes. a wide range of scientists contribute to the BEF-China project, involving groups focusing on multiple diversity dimensions, multiple ecosystem components and multiple ecosystem functions. The dimensions of biodiversity include species diversity, functional diversity and genetic diversity; the components of ecosystem include plants, animals and microorganisms; and the functions of ecosystem include productivity, nutrient cycle, decomposition, multi-trophic interactions, resistance to soil erosion and other stress resistance abilities.</p>
